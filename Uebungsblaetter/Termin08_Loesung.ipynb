To give finer control over the loot distribution, Pyra introduces the function `weighted_sample_loot`. This function takes a list of items and their corresponding weights. The weights assigned to each item represent the probability of that item being chosen from the loot table. Higher weights indicate a higher likelihood of selection. For example, if an item has a weight of 3, it is three times more likely to be chosen than an item with a weight of 1. This will allow her to tailor the loot drops with greater precision."
